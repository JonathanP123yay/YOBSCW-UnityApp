# WELCOME!!!!

This is the Unity app for **YOBSCW** that allows you to get all of the headset positions and connect it to your Mac and output it in OBS.

The app is designed to run on Meta Quest headsets and stream real-time positional and orientation data to a companion application on macOS, which can then be used inside OBS for virtual cameras, scenes, and effects.
